neural network modules implemented in Tensorflow for detailed configuration

Popular neural network modules implemented in Tensorflow mimicing the Keras interface. The motivation is for careful configurations such as weight initialization and weight sharing. And some modules are not implemented in official packages such as Kerase and Tensorflow at that time, so I need to implement them before testing. 

This repo is only for personal usage. Files except for rnn.py, norm.py, fc.py, and init_var.py have not been heavily tested.
